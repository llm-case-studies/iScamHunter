# AI Feedback Request Prompts

Use these prompts to gather specific feedback from different AI personas.

## 🤖 For Grok (The "Crazy Ideas" Dept)
**Goal:** Generate chaotic, vigilante-style feature ideas.

> "We are building 'iScamHunter', a vigilante platform to waste scammers' time. We just launched a Docker Kit with vLLM support. We need WILD product ideas. Think 'Digital Pranks meets Cyber Defense'. What is the most chaotic (but technically legal) feature we could add to frustrate scammers? Go nuts."

## 🧠 For DeepSeek (The "Visuals/Creative" Dept)
**Goal:** Design high-fidelity, cyberpunk UI concepts.

> "We have a cyberpunk-themed store called 'The Armory' for an anti-scam platform. We sell 'Hunter Nodes' (OrangePi 5) and 'Docker Kits'. Design a visual roadmap for us. How should the 'Interceptor' dashboard look? Give us a UI description that feels like a hacker's terminal but is easy to use for a non-techie."

## ⚖️ For GPT-4o (The "Lawyer/Strategist" Dept)
**Goal:** Risk assessment and business modeling.

> "Review this product strategy for 'iScamHunter'. We are selling tools to counter-scam (waste time, capture IPs of attackers).
> 1. What are the liability risks of 'Hunt-in-a-Box' (Self-hosted)?
> 2. How do we frame 'The Interceptor' (AI answering calls) to remain a passive defensive tool rather than an offensive weapon?
> 3. Suggest a tiered pricing model (Freemium vs. Pro Hunter)."
