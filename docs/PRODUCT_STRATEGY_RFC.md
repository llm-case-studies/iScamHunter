# iScamHunter: Product Strategy & RFC (Final)

**Current State:** v1.2 "Civil Defense & Asymmetric Warfare"

## 1. Core Philosophy: Asymmetric Defense
**The Method:** "Appear. Document. Expose."
*   **The Concept:** We rely on **Asymmetric Warfare**. Scammers spend massive resources (call centers, scripts, infrastructure) to find victims. We spend minimal energy to simply **show up, document the interaction, and expose it**.
*   **The Outcome:** The scammer has to run; we just have to stand still. They burn energy; we build evidence.
*   **The Vibe:** "The Hunt" branding is designed to make civil defense feel "cool" for a younger demographic, driving engagement in what is essentially a community documentation project.

## 2. What We Have Built (The Foundation)
*   **The Armory:** Equip the community. Hoodies build awareness; Hardware builds a defensive perimeter.
*   **The Academy:** Knowledge transfer. Gamified lessons to inoculate users against social engineering.
*   **The Lab:** The public record. A graph-based library of known scam patterns.

## 3. The Product Roadmap (Forward Intelligence)

### A. The Pattern Interceptor (Prevention)
*   **Product:** The "Active Signal" middleware.
*   **Function:** It quietly interrupts a user's transaction flow (e.g., checkout) to ask: "Is someone asking you to buy this?"
*   **Value:** A low-friction digital speed bump that breaks the scammer's urgency loop.

### B. The Analyst Sandbox (Intelligence)
*   **Product:** Clean Room Environment.
*   **Function:** A cloud-hosted, disposable browser session (Dockerized) that allows researchers to safely visit, screenshot, and archive scam sites without exposing their own device.
*   **Value:** Safe, scalable evidence collection. We observe; we do not engage.

### C. The Early Warning System (Crowd Defense)
*   **Product:** OrangePi 5 "Home Guard".
*   **Function:** A localized DNS filter that receives real-time updates from "The Lab".
*   **Value:** "Herd Immunity." One user reports a domain -> All Nodes block it instantly.

## 4. Next Steps
*   **Execution:** Focus purely on the "Analyst Sandbox" for safe data collection.
*   **Narrative:** Maintain the "Hunter" aesthetic for engagement, but operate with the precision of a research institute.
