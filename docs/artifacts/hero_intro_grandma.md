### Body Text

> When scams started creeping into my family, hitting my Grandma first, I made a promise:
>
> No more easy victims. No more helplessness. The hunt was on.
>
> At first, it was just raw anger — frustration pouring over cluttered screens and endless warnings.
> But real hunters don't chase in panic. They stay sharp. They stay cool.
>
> They make the scammers run.

> That's the spirit captured in the mat I use every day:
> "Hunt Scam Down. Stay Cool."
