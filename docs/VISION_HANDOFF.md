# Commander's Intent: Operation Civil Defense

**To:** Dev Team (iMac Sector)
**From:** Strategy Core (Linux Sector)
**Status:** GREEN LIGHT 🟢

## The Mission
We have pivoted. We are no longer "hunting" scammers; we are **defending families**.
Your objective is to build the tools that make "Civil Defense" a consumer reality.

## Strategic Objectives (The "What", not the "How")

### 1. Build "The Family Shield" 🛡️
*   **Goal:** A deployable container that protects a non-technical user's home network.
*   **Success State:** Grandma can plug it in, and the "Fake Microsoft Support" page doesn't load.
*   **Freedom of Action:** Choose your base (AdGuard vs Pi-hole). Design the "Block Page" to be educational, not just a 404. Make it feel like a "Digital Airbag".

### 2. Prototype "Hunter Command" 📱
*   **Goal:** A mobile-first interface (PWA or App) that talks to the Shield.
*   **Success State:** I can see on my phone that the Shield blocked a threat.
*   **Freedom of Action:** Experiment with the UX. Should it look like a radar? A feed? A simple "Safe/Unsafe" light? You decide.

### 3. The "Analyst Sandbox" (Safe Mode) 🕵️‍♂️
*   **Goal:** A way for us to look at scam sites without getting infected.
*   **Success State:** One-click to spin up a disposable browser.
*   **Freedom of Action:** Investigation on Kasm vs Neko vs proprietary.

## Guiding Principles
1.  **Safety First:** If it can be used to attack, don't build it.
2.  **Trust the User:** Give them power, but warn them of risks (The Legal Oath).
3.  **Simplicity:** Complexity is the enemy of adoption.

**You have the conn.**
*Execute.*
