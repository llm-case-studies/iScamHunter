The South Sea Bubble (1720)
Source: Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay

The South Sea Company, a British joint-stock company founded in 1711, arguably created the world's first major financial crash. The company was granted a monopoly to trade in the South Seas (South America) in exchange for assuming England's national debt.

The Scheme:
The directors of the company circulated false rumors of immense trade wealth and treaties with Spain that did not exist. They promised investors returns of 100% or more. The stock price rose from £100 to £1,000 in a single year.

The "Bubbles":
In the frenzy, hundreds of other "bubble" companies sprang up. Some were legitimate, but most were absurd frauds. One famous prospectus advertised: "A company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is." The promoter opened an office in Cornhill, took in £2,000 in subscriptions in a single morning, and departed for the Continent that afternoon, never to be seen again.

The Crash:
When the South Sea Company stock peaked, the directors themselves began selling. The panic set in. The stock crashed back to £100. Thousands were ruined, complete estates were confiscated, and the economy of England was devastated. The "mechanism" was simple: inflate the value of an asset with zero underlying utility through pure social hype, then exit before the crowd realizes the truth.
